# Combat Comm Fit
## While deployed, my commander asked me to provide a workout schedule foro our team. I immediately knew I wanted to build a Django app for this.
### This app  is based off of the "Newspaper App" from William Vincent's amazing "Django for Beginners" book (hence the original repo name).

### I will continue to make changes to this app and would love to hear any feedback. This app is completely open source and if you would like to contribute in any way please let me know.

### As I am new to the open-source game, if you have any issues with the repository structure please let me know!
